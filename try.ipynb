       "  'abstract': 'this summary of the doctoral thesis is created to emphasize the close connection of the proposed spectral analysis method with the discrete fourier transform (dft), the most extensively studied and frequently used approach in the history of signal processing. it is shown that in a typical application case, where uniform data readings are transformed to the same number of uniformly spaced frequencies, the results of the classical dft and proposed approach coincide. the difference in performance appears when the length of the dft is selected to be greater than the length of the data. the dft solves the unknown data problem by padding readings with zeros up to the length of the dft, while the proposed extended dft (edft) deals with this situation in a different way, it uses the fourier integral transform as a target and optimizes the transform basis in the extended frequency range without putting such restrictions on the time domain. consequently, the inverse dft (idft) applied to the result of edft returns not only known readings, but also the extrapolated data, where classical dft is able to give back just zeros, and higher resolution are achieved at frequencies where the data has been successfully extended. it has been demonstrated that edft able to process data with missing readings or gaps inside or even nonuniformly distributed data. thus, edft significantly extends the usability of the dft-based methods, where previously these approaches have been considered as not applicable. the edft founds the solution in an iterative way and requires repeated calculations to get the adaptive basis, and this makes it numerical complexity much higher compared to dft. this disadvantage was a serious problem in the 1990s, when the method has been proposed. fortunately, since then the power of computers has increased so much that nowadays edft application could be considered as a real alternative.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '$l^q$-regularization has been demonstrated to be an attractive technique in machine learning and statistical modeling. it attempts to improve the generalization (prediction) capability of a machine (model) through appropriately shrinking its coefficients. the shape of a $l^q$ estimator differs in varying choices of the regularization order $q$. in particular, $l^1$ leads to the lasso estimate, while $l^{2}$ corresponds to the smooth ridge regression. this makes the order $q$ a potential tuning parameter in applications. to facilitate the use of $l^{q}$-regularization, we intend to seek for a modeling strategy where an elaborative selection on $q$ is avoidable. in this spirit, we place our investigation within a general framework of $l^{q}$-regularized kernel learning under a sample dependent hypothesis space (sdhs). for a designated class of kernel functions, we show that all $l^{q}$ estimators for $0< q < \\\\infty$ attain similar generalization error bounds. these estimated bounds are almost optimal in the sense that up to a logarithmic factor, the upper and lower bounds are asymptotically identical. this finding tentatively reveals that, in some modeling contexts, the choice of $q$ might not have a strong impact in terms of the generalization capability. from this perspective, $q$ can be arbitrarily specified, or specified merely by other no generalization criteria like smoothness, computational complexity, sparsity, etc..',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'social network has gained remarkable attention in the last decade. accessing social network sites such as twitter, facebook linkedin and google+ through the internet and the web 2.0 technologies has become more affordable. people are becoming more interested in and relying on social network for information, news and opinion of other users on diverse subject matters. the heavy reliance on social network sites causes them to generate massive data characterised by three computational issues namely; size, noise and dynamism. these issues often make social network data very complex to analyse manually, resulting in the pertinent use of computational means of analysing them. data mining provides a wide range of techniques for detecting useful knowledge from massive datasets like trends, patterns and rules [44]. data mining techniques are used for information retrieval, statistical modelling and machine learning. these techniques employ data pre-processing, data analysis, and data interpretation processes in the course of data analysis. this survey discusses different data mining techniques used in mining diverse aspects of the social network over decades going from the historical techniques to the up-to-date models, including our novel technique named trcm. all the techniques covered in this survey are listed in the table.1 including the tools employed as well as names of their authors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"bayesian classification labels observations based on given prior information, namely class-a priori and class-conditional probabilities. bayes' risk is the minimum expected classification cost that is achieved by the bayes' test, the optimal decision rule. when no cost incurs for correct classification and unit cost is charged for misclassification, bayes' test reduces to the maximum a posteriori decision rule, and bayes risk simplifies to bayes' error, the probability of error. since calculating this probability of error is often intractable, several techniques have been devised to bound it with closed-form formula, introducing thereby measures of similarity and divergence between distributions like the bhattacharyya coefficient and its associated bhattacharyya distance. the bhattacharyya upper bound can further be tightened using the chernoff information that relies on the notion of best error exponent. in this paper, we first express bayes' risk using the total variation distance on scaled distributions. we then elucidate and extend the bhattacharyya and the chernoff upper bound mechanisms using generalized weighted means. we provide as a byproduct novel notions of statistical divergences and affinity coefficients. we illustrate our technique by deriving new upper bounds for the univariate cauchy and the multivariate $t$-distributions, and show experimentally that those bounds are not too distant to the computationally intractable bayes' error.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we propose an active perception method for recognizing object categories based on the multimodal hierarchical dirichlet process (mhdp). the mhdp enables a robot to form object categories using multimodal information, e.g., visual, auditory, and haptic information, which can be observed by performing actions on an object. however, performing many actions on a target object requires a long time. in a real-time scenario, i.e., when the time is limited, the robot has to determine the set of actions that is most effective for recognizing a target object. we propose an mhdp-based active perception method that uses the information gain (ig) maximization criterion and lazy greedy algorithm. we show that the ig maximization criterion is optimal in the sense that the criterion is equivalent to a minimization of the expected kullback--leibler divergence between a final recognition state and the recognition state after the next set of actions. however, a straightforward calculation of ig is practically impossible. therefore, we derive an efficient monte carlo approximation method for ig by making use of a property of the mhdp. we also show that the ig has submodular and non-decreasing properties as a set function because of the structure of the graphical model of the mhdp. therefore, the ig maximization problem is reduced to a submodular maximization problem. this means that greedy and lazy greedy algorithms are effective and have a theoretical justification for their performance. we conducted an experiment using an upper-torso humanoid robot and a second one using synthetic data. the experimental results show that the method enables the robot to select a set of actions that allow it to recognize target objects quickly and accurately. the results support our theoretical outcomes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper we consider two sequence tagging tasks for medieval latin: part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization. these are both basic, yet foundational preprocessing steps in applications such as text re-use detection. nevertheless, they are generally complicated by the considerable orthographic variation which is typical of medieval latin. in digital classics, these tasks are traditionally solved in a (i) cascaded and (ii) lexicon-dependent fashion. for example, a lexicon is used to generate all the potential lemma-tag pairs for a token, and next, a context-aware pos-tagger is used to select the most appropriate tag-lemma pair. apart from the problems with out-of-lexicon items, error percolation is a major downside of such approaches. in this paper we explore the possibility to elegantly solve these tasks using a single, integrated approach. for this, we make use of a layered neural network architecture from the field of deep representation learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'we show that on graphs with n vertices, the 2-dimensional weisfeiler-leman algorithm requires at most o(n^2/log(n)) iterations to reach stabilization. this in particular shows that the previously best, trivial upper bound of o(n^2) is asymptotically not tight. in the logic setting, this translates to the statement that if two graphs of size n can be distinguished by a formula in first-order logic with counting with 3 variables (i.e., in c3), then they can also be distinguished by a c3-formula that has quantifier depth at most o(n^2/log(n)).   to prove the result we define a game between two players that enables us to decouple the causal dependencies between the processes happening simultaneously over several iterations of the algorithm. this allows us to treat large color classes and small color classes separately. as part of our proof we show that for graphs with bounded color class size, the number of iterations until stabilization is at most linear in the number of vertices. this also yields a corresponding statement in first-order logic with counting.   similar results can be obtained for the respective logic without counting quantifiers, i.e., for the logic l3.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'a positional numeration system is given by a base and by a set of digits. the base is a real or complex number $\\\\beta$ such that $|\\\\beta|>1$, and the digit set $a$ is a finite set of digits including $0$. thus a number can be seen as a finite or infinite string of digits. an on-line algorithm processes the input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion. on-line arithmetic, introduced by trivedi and ercegovac, is a mode of computation where operands and results flow through arithmetic units in a digit serial manner, starting with the most significant digit.   in this paper, we first formulate a generalized version of the on-line algorithms for multiplication and division of trivedi and ercegovac for the cases that $\\\\beta$ is any real or complex number, and digits are real or complex. we then define the so-called ol property, and show that if $(\\\\beta, a)$ has the ol property, then on-line multiplication and division are feasible by the trivedi-ercegovac algorithms. for a real base $\\\\beta$ and a digit set $a$ of contiguous integers, the system $(\\\\beta, a)$ has the ol property if $\\\\# a > |\\\\beta|$. for a complex base $\\\\beta$ and symmetric digit set $a$ of contiguous integers, the system $(\\\\beta, a)$ has the ol property if $\\\\# a > \\\\beta\\\\overline{\\\\beta} + |\\\\beta + \\\\overline{\\\\beta}|$. provided that addition and subtraction are realizable in parallel in the system $(\\\\beta, a)$ and that preprocessing of the denominator is possible, our on-line algorithms for multiplication and division have linear time complexity. three examples are presented in detail: base $\\\\beta=\\\\frac{3+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ with digits $a=\\\\{-1,0,1\\\\}$; base $\\\\beta=2i$ with digits $a = \\\\{-2,-1, 0,1,2\\\\}$; and base $\\\\beta = -\\\\frac{3}{2} + i \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} = -1 + \\\\omega$, where $\\\\omega = \\\\exp{\\\\frac{2i\\\\pi}{3}}$, with digits $a = \\\\{0, \\\\pm 1, \\\\pm \\\\omega, \\\\pm \\\\omega^2 \\\\}$.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the algebraic intersection type unification problem is an important component in proof search related to several natural decision problems in intersection type systems. it is unknown and remains open whether the algebraic intersection type unification problem is decidable. we give the first nontrivial lower bound for the problem by showing (our main result) that it is exponential time hard. furthermore, we show that this holds even under rank 1 solutions (substitutions whose codomains are restricted to contain rank 1 types). in addition, we provide a fixed-parameter intractability result for intersection type matching (one-sided unification), which is known to be np-complete.   we place the algebraic intersection type unification problem in the context of unification theory. the equational theory of intersection types can be presented as an algebraic theory with an aci (associative, commutative, and idempotent) operator (intersection type) combined with distributivity properties with respect to a second operator (function type). although the problem is algebraically natural and interesting, it appears to occupy a hitherto unstudied place in the theory of unification, and our investigation of the problem suggests that new methods are required to understand the problem. thus, for the lower bound proof, we were not able to reduce from known results in aci-unification theory and use game-theoretic methods for two-player tiling games.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper describes a computational model, called the dirichlet process gaussian mixture model with latent joints (dpgmm-lj), that can find latent tree structure embedded in data distribution in an unsupervised manner. by combining dpgmm-lj and a pre-existing body map formation method, we propose a method that enables an agent having multi-link body structure to discover its kinematic structure, i.e., body schema, from tactile information alone. the dpgmm-lj is a probabilistic model based on bayesian nonparametrics and an extension of dirichlet process gaussian mixture model (dpgmm). in a simulation experiment, we used a simple fetus model that had five body parts and performed structured random movements in a womb-like environment. it was shown that the method could estimate the number of body parts and kinematic structures without any pre-existing knowledge in many cases. another experiment showed that the degree of motor coordination in random movements affects the result of body schema formation strongly. it is confirmed that the accuracy rate for body schema estimation had the highest value 84.6% when the ratio of motor coordination was 0.9 in our setting. these results suggest that kinematic structure can be estimated from tactile information obtained by a fetus moving randomly in a womb without any visual information even though its accuracy was not so high. they also suggest that a certain degree of motor coordination in random movements and the sufficient dimension of state space that represents the body map are important to estimate body schema correctly.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"we consider mixed powerdomains combining ordinary nondeterminism and probabilistic nondeterminism. we characterise them as free algebras for suitable (in)equation-al theories; we establish functional representation theorems; and we show equivalencies between state transformers and appropriately healthy predicate transformers. the extended nonnegative reals serve as `truth-values'. as usual with powerdomains, everything comes in three flavours: lower, upper, and order-convex. the powerdomains are suitable convex sets of subprobability valuations, corresponding to resolving nondeterministic choice before probabilistic choice. algebraically this corresponds to the probabilistic choice operator distributing over the nondeterministic choice operator. (an alternative approach to combining the two forms of nondeterminism would be to resolve probabilistic choice first, arriving at a domain-theoretic version of random sets. however, as we also show, the algebraic approach then runs into difficulties.)   rather than working directly with valuations, we take a domain-theoretic functional-analytic approach, employing domain-theoretic abstract convex sets called kegelspitzen; these are equivalent to the abstract probabilistic algebras of graham and jones, but are more convenient to work with. so we define power kegelspitzen, and consider free algebras, functional representations, and predicate transformers. to do so we make use of previous work on domain-theoretic cones (d-cones), with the bridge between the two of them being provided by a free d-cone construction on kegelspitzen.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'data compression combined with effective encryption is a common requirement of data storage and transmission. low cost of these operations is often a high priority in order to increase transmission speed and reduce power usage. this requirement is crucial for battery-powered devices with limited resources, such as autonomous remote sensors or implants. well-known and popular encryption techniques are frequently too expensive. this problem is on the increase as machine-to-machine communication and the internet of things are becoming a reality. therefore, there is growing demand for finding trade-offs between security, cost and performance in lightweight cryptography. this article discusses asymmetric numeral systems -- an innovative approach to entropy coding which can be used for compression with encryption. it provides compression ratio comparable with arithmetic coding at similar speed as huffman coding, hence, this coding is starting to replace them in new compressors. additionally, by perturbing its coding tables, the asymmetric numeral system makes it possible to simultaneously encrypt the encoded message at nearly no additional cost. the article introduces this approach and analyzes its security level. the basic application is reducing the number of rounds of some cipher used on ans-compressed data, or completely removing additional encryption layer if reaching a satisfactory protection level.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"clause-elimination procedures that simplify formulas in conjunctive normal form play an important role in modern sat solving. before or during the actual solving process, such procedures identify and remove clauses that are irrelevant to the solving result. these simplifications usually rely on so-called redundancy properties that characterize cases in which the removal of a clause does not affect the satisfiability status of a formula. one particularly successful redundancy property is that of blocked clauses, because it generalizes several other redundancy properties. to find out whether a clause is blocked---and therefore redundant---one only needs to consider its resolution environment, i.e., the clauses with which it can be resolved. for this reason, we say that the redundancy property of blocked clauses is local. in this paper, we show that there exist local redundancy properties that are even more general than blocked clauses. we present a semantic notion of blocking and prove that it constitutes the most general local redundancy property. we furthermore introduce the syntax-based notions of set-blocking and super-blocking, and show that the latter coincides with our semantic blocking notion. in addition, we show how semantic blocking can be alternatively characterized via davis and putnam's rule for eliminating atomic formulas. finally, we perform a detailed complexity analysis and relate our novel redundancy properties to prominent redundancy properties from the literature.\",\n",

(2) leveraging this model, the joint program of flight mission planning and recharging optimization is formulated as a multi-criteria asymmetric traveling salesman problem (atsp), wherein a drone seeks for the time-optimal energy-feasible tour that visits all the target sites and refuels whenever necessary.

       "  'abstract': \"we construct a geometry of interaction (goi: dynamic modeling of gentzen-style cut elimination) for multiplicative-additive linear logic (mall) by employing bucciarelli-ehrhard indexed linear logic mall(i) to handle the additives. our construction is an extension to the additives of the haghverdi-scott categorical formulation (a multiplicative goi situation in a traced monoidal category) for girard's original goi 1. the indices are shown to serve not only in their original denotational level, but also at a finer grained dynamic level so that the peculiarities of additive cut elimination such as superposition, erasure of subproofs, and additive (co-) contraction can be handled with the explicit use of indices. proofs are interpreted as indexed subsets in the category rel, but without the explicit relational composition; instead, execution formulas are run pointwise on the interpretation at each index, w.r.t symmetries of cuts, in a traced monoidal category with a reflexive object and a zero morphism. the sets of indices diminish overall when an execution formula is run, corresponding to the additive cut-elimination procedure (erasure), and allowing recovery of the relational composition. the main theorem is the invariance of the execution formulas along cut elimination so that the formulas converge to the denotations of (cut-free) proofs.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we analyze and compare three of the many algebraic structures that have been used for modeling dependent type theories: categories with families, split type-categories, and representable maps of presheaves. we study these in univalent type theory, where the comparisons between them can be given more elementarily than in set-theoretic foundations. specifically, we construct maps between the various types of structures, and show that assuming the univalence axiom, some of the comparisons are equivalences.   we then analyze how these structures transfer along (weak and strong) equivalences of categories, and, in particular, show how they descend from a category (not assumed univalent/saturated) to its rezk completion. to this end, we introduce relative universes, generalizing the preceding notions, and study the transfer of such relative universes along suitable structure.   we work throughout in (intensional) dependent type theory; some results, but not all, assume the univalence axiom. all the material of this paper has been formalized in coq, over the unimath library.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'it has been known since ehrhard and regnier\\'s seminal work on the taylor expansion of $\\\\lambda$-terms that this operation commutes with normalization: the expansion of a $\\\\lambda$-term is always normalizable and its normal form is the expansion of the b\\\\\"ohm tree of the term. we generalize this result to the non-uniform setting of the algebraic $\\\\lambda$-calculus, i.e. $\\\\lambda$-calculus extended with linear combinations of terms. this requires us to tackle two difficulties: foremost is the fact that ehrhard and regnier\\'s techniques rely heavily on the uniform, deterministic nature of the ordinary $\\\\lambda$-calculus, and thus cannot be adapted; second is the absence of any satisfactory generic extension of the notion of b\\\\\"ohm tree in presence of quantitative non-determinism, which is reflected by the fact that the taylor expansion of an algebraic $\\\\lambda$-term is not always normalizable. our solution is to provide a fine grained study of the dynamics of $\\\\beta$-reduction under taylor expansion, by introducing a notion of reduction on resource vectors, i.e. infinite linear combinations of resource $\\\\lambda$-terms. the latter form the multilinear fragment of the differential $\\\\lambda$-calculus, and resource vectors are the target of the taylor expansion of $\\\\lambda$-terms. we show the reduction of resource vectors contains the image of any $\\\\beta$-reduction step, from which we deduce that taylor expansion and normalization commute on the nose. we moreover identify a class of algebraic $\\\\lambda$-terms, encompassing both normalizable algebraic $\\\\lambda$-terms and arbitrary ordinary $\\\\lambda$-terms: the expansion of these is always normalizable, which guides the definition of a generalization of b\\\\\"ohm trees to this setting.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"elections unleash strong political views on twitter, but what do people really think about politics? opinion and trend mining on micro blogs dealing with politics has recently attracted researchers in several fields including information retrieval and machine learning (ml). since the performance of ml and natural language processing (nlp) approaches are limited by the amount and quality of data available, one promising alternative for some tasks is the automatic propagation of expert annotations. this paper intends to develop a so-called active learning process for automatically annotating french language tweets that deal with the image (i.e., representation, web reputation) of politicians. our main focus is on the methodology followed to build an original annotated dataset expressing opinion from two french politicians over time. we therefore review state of the art nlp-based ml algorithms to automatically annotate tweets using a manual initiation step as bootstrap. this paper focuses on key issues about active learning while building a large annotated data set from noise. this will be introduced by human annotators, abundance of data and the label distribution across data and entities. in turn, we show that twitter characteristics such as the author's name or hashtags can be considered as the bearing point to not only improve automatic systems for opinion mining (om) and topic classification but also to reduce noise in human annotations. however, a later thorough analysis shows that reducing noise might induce the loss of crucial information.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the straightness is a measure designed to characterize a pair of vertices in a spatial graph. it is defined as the ratio of the euclidean distance to the graph distance between these vertices. it is often used as an average, for instance to describe the accessibility of a single vertex relatively to all the other vertices in the graph, or even to summarize the graph as a whole. in some cases, one needs to process the straightness between not only vertices, but also any other points constituting the graph of interest. suppose for instance that our graph represents a road network and we do not want to limit ourselves to crossroad-to-crossroad itineraries, but allow any street number to be a starting point or destination. in this situation, the standard approach consists in: 1) discretizing the graph edges, 2) processing the vertex-to-vertex straightness considering the additional vertices resulting from this discretization, and 3) performing the appropriate average on the obtained values. however, this discrete approximation can be computationally expensive on large graphs, and its precision has not been clearly assessed. in this article, we adopt a continuous approach to average the straightness over the edges of spatial graphs. this allows us to derive 5 distinct measures able to characterize precisely the accessibility of the whole graph, as well as individual vertices and edges. our method is generic and could be applied to other measures designed for spatial graphs. we perform an experimental evaluation of our continuous average straightness measures, and show how they behave differently from the traditional vertex-to-vertex ones. moreover, we also study their discrete approximations, and show that our approach is globally less demanding in terms of both processing time and memory usage. our r source code is publicly available under an open source license.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'conversational agents (cas) play an important role in human computer interaction. creating believable movements for cas is challenging, since the movements have to be meaningful and natural, reflecting the coupling between gestures and speech. studies in the past have mainly relied on rule-based or data-driven approaches. rule-based methods focus on creating meaningful behaviors conveying the underlying message, but the gestures cannot be easily synchronized with speech. data-driven approaches, especially speech-driven models, can capture the relationship between speech and gestures. however, they create behaviors disregarding the meaning of the message. this study proposes to bridge the gap between these two approaches overcoming their limitations. the approach builds a dynamic bayesian network (dbn), where a discrete variable is added to constrain the behaviors on the underlying constraint. the study implements and evaluates the approach with two constraints: discourse functions and prototypical behaviors. by constraining on the discourse functions (e.g., questions), the model learns the characteristic behaviors associated with a given discourse class learning the rules from the data. by constraining on prototypical behaviors (e.g., head nods), the approach can be embedded in a rule-based system as a behavior realizer creating trajectories that are timely synchronized with speech. the study proposes a dbn structure and a training approach that (1) models the cause-effect relationship between the constraint and the gestures, (2) initializes the state configuration models increasing the range of the generated behaviors, and (3) captures the differences in the behaviors across constraints by enforcing sparse transitions between shared and exclusive states per constraint. objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach over an unconstrained model.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the topic diversity of open-domain videos leads to various vocabularies and linguistic expressions in describing video contents, and therefore, makes the video captioning task even more challenging. in this paper, we propose an unified caption framework, m&m tgm, which mines multimodal topics in unsupervised fashion from data and guides the caption decoder with these topics. compared to pre-defined topics, the mined multimodal topics are more semantically and visually coherent and can reflect the topic distribution of videos better. we formulate the topic-aware caption generation as a multi-task learning problem, in which we add a parallel task, topic prediction, in addition to the caption task. for the topic prediction task, we use the mined topics as the teacher to train a student topic prediction model, which learns to predict the latent topics from multimodal contents of videos. the topic prediction provides intermediate supervision to the learning process. as for the caption task, we propose a novel topic-aware decoder to generate more accurate and detailed video descriptions with the guidance from latent topics. the entire learning procedure is end-to-end and it optimizes both tasks simultaneously. the results from extensive experiments conducted on the msr-vtt and youtube2text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. m&m tgm not only outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics and on both benchmark datasets, but also achieves better generalization ability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'we develop a new semi-algebraic proof system called stabbing planes which formalizes modern branch-and-cut algorithms for integer programming and is in the style of dpll-based modern sat solvers. as with dpll there is only a single rule: the current polytope can be subdivided by branching on an inequality and its \"integer negation.\" that is, we can (nondeterministically choose) a hyperplane $ax \\\\geq b$ with integer coefficients, which partitions the polytope into three pieces: the points in the polytope satisfying $ax \\\\geq b$, the points satisfying $ax \\\\leq b-1$, and the middle slab $b - 1 < ax < b$. since the middle slab contains no integer points it can be safely discarded, and the algorithm proceeds recursively on the other two branches. each path terminates when the current polytope is empty, which is polynomial-time checkable. among our results, we show that stabbing planes can efficiently simulate the cutting planes proof system, and is equivalent to a tree-like variant of the rcp system of [krajicek98]. as well, we show that it possesses short proofs of the canonical family of systems of $\\\\mathbb{f}_2$-linear equations known as the tseitin formulas. finally, we prove linear lower bounds on the rank of stabbing planes refutations by adapting lower bounds in communication complexity and use these bounds in order to show that stabbing planes proofs cannot be balanced. in doing so, we show that real communication protocols cannot be balanced and establish the first lower bound on the real communication complexity of the set disjointness function.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'we study the bisimilarity problem for probabilistic pushdown automata (ppda) and subclasses thereof. our definition of ppda allows both probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, generalising the classical notion of pushdown automata (without epsilon-transitions). we first show a general characterization of probabilistic bisimilarity in terms of two-player games, which naturally reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic labelled transition systems to checking bisimilarity of standard (non-deterministic) labelled transition systems. this reduction can be easily implemented in the framework of ppda, allowing to use known results for standard (non-probabilistic) pda and their subclasses. a direct use of the reduction incurs an exponential increase of complexity, which does not matter in deriving decidability of bisimilarity for ppda due to the non-elementary complexity of the problem. in the cases of probabilistic one-counter automata (poca), of probabilistic visibly pushdown automata (pvpda), and of probabilistic basic process algebras (i.e., single-state ppda) we show that an implicit use of the reduction can avoid the complexity increase; we thus get pspace, exptime, and 2-exptime upper bounds, respectively, like for the respective non-probabilistic versions. the bisimilarity problems for oca and vpda are known to have matching lower bounds (thus being pspace-complete and exptime-complete, respectively); we show that these lower bounds also hold for fully probabilistic versions that do not use non-determinism.',\n",

(that model happens to be the second universe in jensen's hierarchy.) then we show that already this minimal theory suffices for developing very large portions (if not all) of scientifically applicable mathematics. this requires treating the collection of real numbers as a proper class, that is: a unary predicate which can be introduced in the theory by the static extension method described in the first part of the paper.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'event structures are a well-accepted model of concurrency. in a seminal paper by nielsen, plotkin and winskel, they are used to establish a bridge between the theory of domains and the approach to concurrency proposed by petri. a basic role is played by an unfolding construction that maps (safe) petri nets into a subclass of event structures, called prime event structures, where each event has a uniquely determined set of causes. prime event structures, in turn, can be identified with their domain of configurations. at a categorical level, this is nicely formalised by winskel as a chain of coreflections.   contrary to prime event structures, general event structures allow for the presence of disjunctive causes, i.e., events can be enabled by distinct minimal sets of events. in this paper, we extend the connection between petri nets and event structures in order to include disjunctive causes. in particular, we show that, at the level of nets, disjunctive causes are well accounted for by persistent places. these are places where tokens, once generated, can be used several times without being consumed and where multiple tokens are interpreted collectively, i.e., their histories are inessential. generalising the work on ordinary nets, petri nets with persistence are related to a new subclass of general event structures, called locally connected, by means of a chain of coreflections relying on an unfolding construction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'deep metric learning has been demonstrated to be highly effective in learning semantic representation and encoding information that can be used to measure data similarity, by relying on the embedding learned from metric learning. at the same time, variational autoencoder (vae) has widely been used to approximate inference and proved to have a good performance for directed probabilistic models. however, for traditional vae, the data label or feature information are intractable. similarly, traditional representation learning approaches fail to represent many salient aspects of the data. in this project, we propose a novel integrated framework to learn latent embedding in vae by incorporating deep metric learning. the features are learned by optimizing a triplet loss on the mean vectors of vae in conjunction with standard evidence lower bound (elbo) of vae. this approach, which we call triplet based variational autoencoder (tvae), allows us to capture more fine-grained information in the latent embedding. our model is tested on mnist data set and achieves a high triplet accuracy of 95.60% while the traditional vae (kingma & welling, 2013) achieves triplet accuracy of 75.08%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"ehrhard, pagani and tasson proposed a model of probabilistic functional programming in a category of normed positive cones and stable measurable cone maps, which can be seen as a coordinate-free generalization of probabilistic coherence spaces. however, unlike the case of probabilistic coherence spaces, it remained unclear if the model could be refined to a model of classical linear logic.   in this work we consider a somewhat similar category which gives indeed a coordinate-free model of full propositional linear logic with nondegenerate interpretation of additives and sound interpretation of exponentials. objects are dual pairs of normed cones satisfying certain specific completeness properties, such as existence of norm-bounded monotone weak limits, and morphisms are bounded (adjointable) positive maps. norms allow us a distinct interpretation of dual additive connectives as product and coproduct. exponential connectives are modelled using real analytic functions and distributions that have representations as power series with positive coefficients.   unlike the familiar case of probabilistic coherence spaces, there is no reference or need for a preferred basis; in this sense the model is invariant. probabilistic coherence spaces form a full subcategory, whose objects, seen as posets, are lattices. thus we get a model fitting in the tradition of interpreting linear logic in a linear algebraic setting, which arguably is free from the drawbacks of its predecessors.   relations with constructions of ehrhard, pagani and tasson's work are left for future research.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the question of whether there is a logic that captures polynomial time is one of the main open problems in descriptive complexity theory and database theory. in 2010 grohe showed that fixed point logic with counting captures polynomial time on all classes of graphs with excluded minors. we now consider classes of graphs with excluded induced subgraphs. for such graph classes, an effective graph decomposition, called modular decomposition, was introduced by gallai in 1976. the graphs that are non-decomposable with respect to modular decomposition are called prime. we present a tool, the modular decomposition theorem, that reduces (definable) canonization of a graph class c to (definable) canonization of the class of prime graphs of c that are colored with binary relations on a linearly ordered set. by an application of the modular decomposition theorem, we show that fixed point logic with counting captures polynomial time on the class of permutation graphs. within the proof of the modular decomposition theorem, we show that the modular decomposition of a graph is definable in symmetric transitive closure logic with counting. we obtain that the modular decomposition tree is computable in logarithmic space. it follows that cograph recognition and cograph canonization is computable in logarithmic space.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'recognizing emotions using few attribute dimensions such as arousal, valence and dominance provides the flexibility to effectively represent complex range of emotional behaviors. conventional methods to learn these emotional descriptors primarily focus on separate models to recognize each of these attributes. recent work has shown that learning these attributes together regularizes the models, leading to better feature representations. this study explores new forms of regularization by adding unsupervised auxiliary tasks to reconstruct hidden layer representations. this auxiliary task requires the denoising of hidden representations at every layer of an auto-encoder. the framework relies on ladder networks that utilize skip connections between encoder and decoder layers to learn powerful representations of emotional dimensions. the results show that ladder networks improve the performance of the system compared to baselines that individually learn each attribute, and conventional denoising autoencoders. furthermore, the unsupervised auxiliary tasks have promising potential to be used in a semi-supervised setting, where few labeled sentences are available.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'game theory provides a well-established framework for the analysis of concurrent and multi-agent systems. the basic idea is that concurrent processes (agents) can be understood as corresponding to players in a game; plays represent the possible computation runs of the system; and strategies define the behaviour of agents. typically, strategies are modelled as functions from sequences of system states to player actions. analysing a system in such a setting involves computing the set of (nash) equilibria in the concurrent game. however, we show that, with respect to the above model of strategies (arguably, the \"standard\" model in the computer science literature), bisimilarity does not preserve the existence of nash equilibria. thus, two concurrent games which are behaviourally equivalent from a semantic perspective, and which from a logical perspective satisfy the same temporal logic formulae, may nevertheless have fundamentally different properties (solutions) from a game theoretic perspective. our aim in this paper is to explore the issues raised by this discovery. after illustrating the issue by way of a motivating example, we present three models of strategies with respect to which the existence of nash equilibria is preserved under bisimilarity. we use some of these models of strategies to provide new semantic foundations for logics for strategic reasoning, and investigate restricted scenarios where bisimilarity can be shown to preserve the existence of nash equilibria with respect to the conventional model of strategies in the computer science literature.',\n",

($h$ is rainbow if all its edges get distinct colors). the concept of anti-ramsey number was introduced by erd\\\\\"os, simanovitz, and s\\\\\\'os in 1973. thereafter several researchers investigated this concept in the combinatorial setting. recently, feng et al. revisited the anti-ramsey problem for the pattern graph $k_{1,t}$ (for $t \\\\geq 3$) purely from an algorithmic point of view due to its applications in interference modeling of wireless networks. they posed it as an optimization problem, the maximum edge $q$-coloring problem. for a graph $g$ and an integer $q\\\\geq 2$, an edge $q$-coloring of $g$ is an assignment of colors to edges of $g$, such that edges incident on a vertex span at most $q$ distinct colors. the maximum edge $q$-coloring problem seeks to maximize the number of colors in an edge $q$-coloring of the graph $g$. note that the optimum value of the edge $q$-coloring problem of $g$ equals $ar(g,k_{1,q+1})$. in this paper, we study $ar(g,k_{1,t})$, the anti-ramsey number of stars, for each fixed integer $t\\\\geq 3$, both from combinatorial and algorithmic point of view. the first of our main results presents an upper bound for $ar(g,k_{1,q+1})$, in terms of number of vertices and the minimum degree of $g$. the second one improves this result for the case of triangle-free input graphs. for a positive integer $t$, let $h_t$ denote a subgraph of $g$ with maximum number of possible edges and maximum degree $t$. our third main result presents an upper bound for $ar(g,k_{1,q+1})$ in terms of $|e(h_{q-1})|$. all our results have algorithmic consequences.',\n",

(1992). motivated by the shaky evidence used to support this claim in neural networks, we measure bias and variance in the modern setting. we find that both bias and variance can decrease as the number of parameters grows. to better understand this, we introduce a new decomposition of the variance to disentangle the effects of optimization and data sampling. we also provide theoretical analysis in a simplified setting that is consistent with our empirical findings.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'named entity recognition (ner) is the task to identify mentions of rigid designators from text belonging to predefined semantic types such as person, location, organization etc. ner always serves as the foundation for many natural language applications such as question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. early ner systems got a huge success in achieving good performance with the cost of human engineering in designing domain-specific features and rules. in recent years, deep learning, empowered by continuous real-valued vector representations and semantic composition through nonlinear processing, has been employed in ner systems, yielding stat-of-the-art performance. in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on existing deep learning techniques for ner. we first introduce ner resources, including tagged ner corpora and off-the-shelf ner tools. then, we systematically categorize existing works based on a taxonomy along three axes: distributed representations for input, context encoder, and tag decoder. next, we survey the most representative methods for recent applied techniques of deep learning in new ner problem settings and applications. finally, we present readers with the challenges faced by ner systems and outline future directions in this area.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'integrity constraints such as functional dependencies (fd) and multi-valued dependencies (mvd) are fundamental in database schema design. likewise, probabilistic conditional independences (ci) are crucial for reasoning about multivariate probability distributions. the implication problem studies whether a set of constraints (antecedents) implies another constraint (consequent), and has been investigated in both the database and the ai literature, under the assumption that all constraints hold exactly. however, many applications today consider constraints that hold only approximately. in this paper we define an approximate implication as a linear inequality between the degree of satisfaction of the antecedents and consequent, and we study the relaxation problem: when does an exact implication relax to an approximate implication? we use information theory to define the degree of satisfaction, and prove several results. first, we show that any implication from a set of data dependencies (mvds+fds) can be relaxed to a simple linear inequality with a factor at most quadratic in the number of variables; when the consequent is an fd, the factor can be reduced to 1. second, we prove that there exists an implication between cis that does not admit any relaxation; however, we prove that every implication between cis relaxes \"in the limit\". then, we show that the implication problem for differential constraints in market basket analysis also admits a relaxation with a factor equal to 1. finally, we show how some of the results in the paper can be derived using the i-measure theory, which relates between information theoretic measures and set theory. our results recover, and sometimes extend, previously known results about the implication problem: the implication of mvds and fds can be checked by considering only 2-tuple relations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"the study of approximate matching in the massively parallel computations (mpc) model has recently seen a burst of breakthroughs. despite this progress, however, we still have a far more limited understanding of maximal matching which is one of the central problems of parallel and distributed computing. all known mpc algorithms for maximal matching either take polylogarithmic time which is considered inefficient, or require a strictly super-linear space of $n^{1+\\\\omega(1)}$ per machine.   in this work, we close this gap by providing a novel analysis of an extremely simple algorithm a variant of which was conjectured to work by czumaj et al. [stoc'18]. the algorithm edge-samples the graph, randomly partitions the vertices, and finds a random greedy maximal matching within each partition. we show that this algorithm drastically reduces the vertex degrees. this, among some other results, leads to an $o(\\\\log \\\\log \\\\delta)$ round algorithm for maximal matching with $o(n)$ space (or even mildly sublinear in $n$ using standard techniques).   as an immediate corollary, we get a $2$ approximate minimum vertex cover in essentially the same rounds and space. this is the best possible approximation factor under standard assumptions, culminating a long line of research. it also leads to an improved $o(\\\\log\\\\log \\\\delta)$ round algorithm for $1 + \\\\varepsilon$ approximate matching. all these results can also be implemented in the congested clique model within the same number of rounds.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this paper, we study the secrecy throughput of a full-duplex wireless powered communication network (wpcn) for internet of things (iot). the wpcn consists of a full-duplex multi-antenna base station (bs) and a number of sensor nodes. the bs transmits energy all the time, and each node harvests energy prior to its transmission time slot. the nodes sequentially transmit their confidential information to the bs, and the other nodes are considered as potential eavesdroppers. we first formulate the sum secrecy throughput optimization problem of all the nodes. the optimization variables are the duration of the time slots and the bs beamforming vectors in different time slots. the problem is shown to be non-convex. to tackle the problem, we propose a suboptimal two stage approach, referred to as sum secrecy throughput maximization (sstm). in the first stage, the bs focuses its beamforming to blind the potential eavesdroppers (other nodes) during information transmission time slots. then, the optimal beamforming vector in the initial non-information transmission time slot and the optimal time slots are derived. we then consider fairness among the nodes and propose max-min fair (mmf) and proportional fair (plf) algorithms. the mmf algorithm maximizes the minimum secrecy throughput of the nodes, while the plf tries to achieve a good trade-off between the sum secrecy throughput and fairness among the nodes. through numerical simulations, we first demonstrate the superior performance of the sstm to uniform time slotting and beamforming in different settings. then, we show the effectiveness of the proposed fair algorithms.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"like termination, confluence is a central property of rewrite systems. unlike for termination, however, there exists no known complexity hierarchy for confluence. in this paper we investigate whether the decreasing diagrams technique can be used to obtain such a hierarchy. the decreasing diagrams technique is one of the strongest and most versatile methods for proving confluence of abstract rewrite systems. it is complete for countable systems, and it has many well-known confluence criteria as corollaries.   so what makes decreasing diagrams so powerful? in contrast to other confluence techniques, decreasing diagrams employ a labelling of the steps with labels from a well-founded order in order to conclude confluence of the underlying unlabelled relation. hence it is natural to ask how the size of the label set influences the strength of the technique. in particular, what class of abstract rewrite systems can be proven confluent using decreasing diagrams restricted to 1 label, 2 labels, 3 labels, and so on? surprisingly, we find that two labels suffice for proving confluence for every abstract rewrite system having the cofinality property, thus in particular for every confluent, countable system.   secondly, we show that this result stands in sharp contrast to the situation for commutation of rewrite relations, where the hierarchy does not collapse.   thirdly, investigating the possibility of a confluence hierarchy, we determine the first-order (non-)definability of the notion of confluence and related properties, using techniques from finite model theory. we find that in particular hanf's theorem is fruitful for elegant proofs of undefinability of properties of abstract rewrite systems.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper presents an efficient neural network model to generate robotic grasps with high resolution images. the proposed model uses fully convolution neural network to generate robotic grasps for each pixel using 400 $\\\\times$ 400 high resolution rgb-d images. it first down-sample the images to get features and then up-sample those features to the original size of the input as well as combines local and global features from different feature maps. compared to other regression or classification methods for detecting robotic grasps, our method looks more like the segmentation methods which solves the problem through pixel-wise ways. we use cornell grasp dataset to train and evaluate the model and get high accuracy about 94.42% for image-wise and 91.02% for object-wise and fast prediction time about 8ms. we also demonstrate that without training on the multiple objects dataset, our model can directly output robotic grasps candidates for different objects because of the pixel wise implementation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'to improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. the information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. however, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. in contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. in this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. with two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. we also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. secondary, we see that l2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the concept of decomposition in computer science and engineering is considered a fundamental component of computational thinking and is prevalent in design of algorithms, software construction, hardware design, and more. we propose a simple and natural formalization of sequential decomposition, in which a task is decomposed into two sequential sub-tasks, with the first sub-task to be executed before the second sub-task is executed. these tasks are specified by means of input/output relations. we define and study decomposition problems, which is to decide whether a given specification can be sequentially decomposed. our main result is that decomposition itself is a difficult computational problem. more specifically, we study decomposition problems in three settings: where the input task is specified explicitly, by means of boolean circuits, and by means of automatic relations. we show that in the first setting decomposition is np-complete, in the second setting it is nexptime-complete, and in the third setting there is evidence to suggest that it is undecidable. our results indicate that the intuitive idea of decomposition as a system-design approach requires further investigation. in particular, we show that adding a human to the loop by asking for a decomposition hint lowers the complexity of decomposition problems considerably.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'knowledge graph is a popular format for representing knowledge, with many applications to semantic search engines, question-answering systems, and recommender systems. real-world knowledge graphs are usually incomplete, so knowledge graph embedding methods, such as canonical decomposition/parallel factorization (cp), distmult, and complex, have been proposed to address this issue. these methods represent entities and relations as embedding vectors in semantic space and predict the links between them. the embedding vectors themselves contain rich semantic information and can be used in other applications such as data analysis. however, mechanisms in these models and the embedding vectors themselves vary greatly, making it difficult to understand and compare them. given this lack of understanding, we risk using them ineffectively or incorrectly, particularly for complicated models, such as cp, with two role-based embedding vectors, or the state-of-the-art complex model, with complex-valued embedding vectors. in this paper, we propose a multi-embedding interaction mechanism as a new approach to uniting and generalizing these models. we derive them theoretically via this mechanism and provide empirical analyses and comparisons between them. we also propose a new multi-embedding model based on quaternion algebra and show that it achieves promising results using popular benchmarks. source code is available on github at https://github.com/tranhungnghiep/analyzekge.',\n",

(2) the variance of gradient magnitude matters. we propose an effective and simple solution to enhance mae's fitting ability while preserving its noise-robustness. without changing mae's overall weighting scheme, i.e., what examples get higher weights, we simply change its weighting variance non-linearly so that the impact ratio between two examples are adjusted. our solution is termed improved mae (imae). we prove imae's effectiveness using extensive experiments: image classification under clean labels, synthetic label noise, and real-world unknown noise.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'multiplex networks have become increasingly more prevalent in many fields, and have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling the complexity of real networks. there is a critical need for developing inference models for multiplex networks that can take into account potential dependencies across different layers, particularly when the aim is community detection. we add to a limited literature by proposing a novel and efficient bayesian model for community detection in multiplex networks. a key feature of our approach is the ability to model varying communities at different network layers. in contrast, many existing models assume the same communities for all layers. moreover, our model automatically picks up the necessary number of communities at each layer (as validated by real data examples). this is appealing, since deciding the number of communities is a challenging aspect of community detection, and especially so in the multiplex setting, if one allows the communities to change across layers. borrowing ideas from hierarchical bayesian modeling, we use a hierarchical dirichlet prior to model community labels across layers, allowing dependency in their structure. given the community labels, a stochastic block model (sbm) is assumed for each layer. we develop an efficient slice sampler for sampling the posterior distribution of the community labels as well as the link probabilities between communities. in doing so, we address some unique challenges posed by coupling the complex likelihood of sbm with the hierarchical nature of the prior on the labels. an extensive empirical validation is performed on simulated and real data, demonstrating the superior performance of the model over single-layer alternatives, as well as the ability to uncover interesting structures in real networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'frequency is one of the major factors for training quality word embeddings. several work has recently discussed the stability of word embeddings in general domain and suggested factors influencing the stability. in this work, we conduct a detailed analysis on the stability of concept embeddings in medical domain, particularly the relation with concept frequency. the analysis reveals the surprising high stability of low-frequency concepts: low-frequency (<100) concepts have the same high stability as high-frequency (>1000) concepts. to develop a deeper understanding of this finding, we propose a new factor, the noisiness of context words, which influences the stability of medical concept embeddings, regardless of frequency. we evaluate the proposed factor by showing the linear correlation with the stability of medical concept embeddings. the correlations are clear and consistent with various groups of medical concepts. based on the linear relations, we make suggestions on ways to adjust the noisiness of context words for the improvement of stability. finally, we demonstrate that the proposed factor extends to the word embedding stability in general domain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in evidence-based medicine, relevance of medical literature is determined by predefined relevance conditions. the conditions are defined based on pico elements, namely, patient, intervention, comparator, and outcome. hence, pico annotations in medical literature are essential for automatic relevant document filtering. however, defining boundaries of text spans for pico elements is not straightforward. in this paper, we study the agreement of pico annotations made by multiple human annotators, including both experts and non-experts. agreements are estimated by a standard span agreement (i.e., matching both labels and boundaries of text spans), and two types of relaxed span agreement (i.e., matching labels without guaranteeing matching boundaries of spans). based on the analysis, we report two observations: (i) boundaries of pico span annotations by individual human annotators are very diverse. (ii) despite the disagreement in span boundaries, general areas of the span annotations are broadly agreed by annotators. our results suggest that applying a standard agreement alone may undermine the agreement of pico spans, and adopting both a standard and a relaxed agreements is more suitable for pico span evaluation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'although traffic sign detection has been studied for years and great progress has been made with the rise of deep learning technique, there are still many problems remaining to be addressed. for complicated real-world traffic scenes, there are two main challenges. firstly, traffic signs are usually small size objects, which makes it more difficult to detect than large ones; secondly, it is hard to distinguish false targets which resemble real traffic signs in complex street scenes without context information. to handle these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning method for traffic sign detection in complex environments. our contributions are as follows: 1) we propose a multi-resolution feature fusion network architecture which exploits densely connected deconvolution layers with skip connections, and can learn more effective features for the small size object; 2) we frame the traffic sign detection as a spatial sequence classification and regression task, and propose a vertical spatial sequence attention (vssa) module to gain more context information for better detection performance. to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method, we do experiments on several traffic sign datasets as well as the general object detection dataset and the results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'change detection (cd) is an important application of remote sensing, which provides timely change information about large-scale earth surface. with the emergence of hyperspectral imagery, cd technology has been greatly promoted, as hyperspectral data with the highspectral resolution are capable of detecting finer changes than using the traditional multispectral imagery. nevertheless, the high dimension of hyperspectral data makes it difficult to implement traditional cd algorithms. besides, endmember abundance information at subpixel level is often not fully utilized. in order to better handle high dimension problem and explore abundance information, this paper presents a general end-to-end two-dimensional cnn (getnet) framework for hyperspectral image change detection (hsi-cd). the main contributions of this work are threefold: 1) mixed-affinity matrix that integrates subpixel representation is introduced to mine more cross-channel gradient features and fuse multi-source information; 2) 2-d cnn is designed to learn the discriminative features effectively from multi-source data at a higher level and enhance the generalization ability of the proposed cd algorithm; 3) a new hsi-cd data set is designed for the objective comparison of different methods. experimental results on real hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the proposed method outperforms most of the state-of-the-arts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"weighted a* (wa*) is a widely used algorithm for rapidly, but suboptimally, solving planning and search problems. the cost of the solution it produces is guaranteed to be at most w times the optimal solution cost, where w is the weight wa* uses in prioritizing open nodes. w is therefore a suboptimality bound for the solution produced by wa*. there is broad consensus that this bound is not very accurate, that the actual suboptimality of wa*'s solution is often much less than w times optimal. however, there is very little published evidence supporting that view, and no existing explanation of why w is a poor bound. this paper fills in these gaps in the literature. we begin with a large-scale experiment demonstrating that, across a wide variety of domains and heuristics for those domains, w is indeed very often far from the true suboptimality of wa*'s solution. we then analytically identify the potential sources of error. finally, we present a practical method for correcting for two of these sources of error and experimentally show that the correction frequently eliminates much of the error.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in rank aggregation (ra), a collection of preferences from different users are summarized into a total order under the assumption of homogeneity of users. model misspecification in ra arises since the homogeneity assumption fails to be satisfied in the complex real-world situation. existing robust ras usually resort to an augmentation of the ranking model to account for additional noises, where the collected preferences can be treated as a noisy perturbation of idealized preferences. since the majority of robust ras rely on certain perturbation assumptions, they cannot generalize well to agnostic noise-corrupted preferences in the real world. in this paper, we propose coarsenrank, which possesses robustness against model misspecification. specifically, the properties of our coarsenrank are summarized as follows: (1) coarsenrank is designed for mild model misspecification, which assumes there exist the ideal preferences (consistent with model assumption) that locates in a neighborhood of the actual preferences. (2) coarsenrank then performs regular ras over a neighborhood of the preferences instead of the original dataset directly. therefore, coarsenrank enjoys robustness against model misspecification within a neighborhood. (3) the neighborhood of the dataset is defined via their empirical data distributions. further, we put an exponential prior on the unknown size of the neighborhood, and derive a much-simplified posterior formula for coarsenrank under particular divergence measures. (4) coarsenrank is further instantiated to coarsened thurstone, coarsened bradly-terry, and coarsened plackett-luce with three popular probability ranking models. meanwhile, tractable optimization strategies are introduced with regards to each instantiation respectively. in the end, we apply coarsenrank on four real-world datasets.',\n",

      "Contributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst\n",

      "foremost challenge is the need to identify the “right” features\n",
      "that will assist in the accurate prediction of conﬂicts. Based\n",
      "on observations from the data and consultations with domain\n",
      "experts, conﬂicts tend to happen in certain types of areas\n",
      "(near water bodies, low elevation areas, etc.) depending on\n",
      "the time period. Second, the conﬂicts are very sparse and not\n",
      "evenly distributed temporally and spatially. For instance, the\n",
      "dataset used in this paper has only 0.38 conﬂicts per month\n",
      "per 100 km2. This poses a major challenge while trying to\n",
      "apply traditional machine learning tools to predict conﬂicts.\n",
      "Thirdly, for predictions to be useful, they have to be at a\n",
      "spatial granularity of a large village or few small villages ( \u0019\n",
      "4 km\u00024 km), which is challenging.\n",
      "To address these challenges, we make the following key\n",
      "contributions: (i) We investigate a wide variety of features\n",
      "and conclude that simple features (like latitude, longitude,\n",
      "and terrain elevation) are insufﬁcient in predicting conﬂicts\n",
      "successfully; (ii) Therefore, we move to more complex fea-\n",
      "tures such as satellite images and we provide a novel way\n",
      "of generating more training data for training Convolutional\n",
      "Neural Networks (CNNs) to make intensity predictions; (iii)\n",
      "To better handle sparse training data, we provide a way to\n",
      "apply curriculum learning and also provide a novel hierar-\n",
      "chical classiﬁcation approach. Finally, on the real test data\n",
